PMTool
============

What is PMTool?
---------------------

PMtool is dead and no longer maintained == PMtool is a project management software (based on PHP+MySQL) 
to create tasks for change/bug requests, post timesheets, and calculate number of times used.

Plus, it's completely free â€“ you'll never have to pay any license fees to use
PMTool.


Status
------

PMTool 2.0 is under heavy development and not recommended for a production
environment.  


Requirements
------------

* PHP 5.3
* MySQL 4.1

Installation
------------

PMTool 2.0 is in an early development stage.  We strongly recommend
against using PMTool 1.2.3 in a production environment.  To install, simply
upload all files to your web server, point your browser to the *install*
directory, and follow the on-screen instructions.


Why Open Source?
----------------

PMTool has traditionally been developed in our spare time, which makes it
rather difficult to release new versions on a reliable schedule. Our customers
have been clamoring for more frequent updates or the ability to merge their own
fixes and additions into the codebase. We are open-sourcing this product because
we want to see it continue to grow and thrive with the help of the community,
rather than be hampered by limited resources.


Plan
--------

Let's get the ACP (backend) as closed to finished as possible before working on
the frontend.  We're almost there!

The frontend needs a good amount of work.  It's using a lot of old code from
PMTool 1.0.  Let's not worry about looks right now.  Focus on
functionality.  We'll skin it up all nice and pretty later.

or link us to your branch, that's cool too.
