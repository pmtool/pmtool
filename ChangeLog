  @N added the ability to configure the behavior for which kind of tasks the
     customer has to pay for. (see cfg/config.inc.php --> $config['paytasks'])
  @N added project priorities.
     NOTE: you have to apply the latest update sql script (table_update_1.2.1.sql to add this row)
     --> now we have two classes which have an attribute "priority", so i've
         moved the according code into a separate class "priority.inc.php".
         both classes (task (via request) and project) inherit from this one.

        If you are upgrading from a previous version, please
        execute the following commands at mysql prompt:

        mysql> use pmtool;
        mysql> update user set access='a' where username='<your username>';
        mysql> exit;

        This is needed, to give yourself initial admin access.

        Thanks to Thomas Kho again ;)
      + new   : new page "reports" to create a list
                of your jobs for the last days. Good
                for creating status reports for your
                project manager ;)

2001-07-15: V0.9.3
      + new   : support for creating excel-sheets on the
                fly (in stats page) requires the PERL-Modul
                "Spreadsheet::WriteExcel" !
                See README for further details
      + new   : you can sort all pages by clicking the
                table header, a click again reverts the order
      + new   : taskbar utility
                this is a VERY usefull tool for windows users
                - just rightclick on your startmenu, choose
                  iconbar, new iconbar... and place the url
                  "http://<pmtool-location>/taskbar.php"
                  into the field "foldername" - it seems to be
                  freaky, but it works cool ;)
      + bugfix: "posted" time was shown wrong on task page
      + new   : extended structure of table "user"
                Now it's possible to authenticate users with Remote-IP.
                If no IP from user-table matches the submitted
                Client-IP, the regular user/password dialogue
                will be shown.
                Note: if the user comes through a proxy like squid,
                pmtool will detect it and uses $HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR
                instead of $REMOTE_ADDR for authentication

        If you allready have installed a version without
        the fields "ip" and "access", execute the following
        commands at mysql prompt:

        mysql> use pmtool;
        mysql> ALTER TABLE user ADD ip CHAR (15) not null;
        mysql> ALTER TABLE user ADD access CHAR (10) not null;
        mysql> exit;

        the "access"-field will be used for further releases ;)

2001-07-13: V0.9.2
      + bugfix: stripped the newline at the end of all files in "inc"
      + change: better logout.php ;)
      + bugfix: fixes in get_time() and db_selectbox()

                if you allready have installed a version without
                the fields "title,phone,fax...", execute the following
                commands at mysql prompt:

        mysql> use pmtool;
        mysql> ALTER TABLE customer ADD title CHAR (100) not null AFTER id;
        mysql> ALTER TABLE customer ADD lastname CHAR (100) not null AFTER name;
        mysql> ALTER TABLE customer CHANGE name firstname CHAR (100) not null;
        mysql> ALTER TABLE customer ADD phone CHAR (100) not null AFTER city;
        mysql> ALTER TABLE customer ADD fax CHAR (100) not null AFTER phone;
        mysql> ALTER TABLE customer ADD cellphone CHAR (100) not null AFTER fax;
        mysql> exit;

        After that you should split the customer name into firstname and lastname
        by changing the records on customer page

2001-06-15:
      + new   : preselected username on loginpage after klicking the
                link in the autogenerated email if the user authenticated
                himself by using HTTP-Basic-Auth and both usernames are the same

2001-06-14:
      + new   : password support added

        if you allready have installed a version without
        password support, execute the following commands at
        mysql prompt:

        mysql> use pmtool;
        mysql> ALTER TABLE user ADD password CHAR (20) not null AFTER username;
